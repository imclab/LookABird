## About This Guide


Most, if not a great majority, of the books that have birds as the main subject matter focus on enumeration and identification of these creatures.

They tought the precision and accuracy of their visual aids which allow you to pinpoint a particular genus, species with great haste. They typically make claims about their comprehensive nature - attempting to include every bird that could possibly be spotted in a specific country, region, or town.

And indeed, when you are attempting to decode the particulars of plumage or posture in order to identify an unfamiliar feathered __TODO__, you want a book that is acurate and complete enough to allow you to perform this task.

However, the stated goal of this guide is slightly different from these others. Instead of identification, this guide encourages only recognition. An increase in the perception and appreciation of the natural world around you are the sole aspirations of this short manual. 

As such, this guide is sparse on bird types. To a fault! As your rough estimate of the number of pages included in this document would imply, I attempt to introduce only a handful of __TODO__ to the reader. No doubt either leaving you wanting more or frustrating you to the point of throwing away the book, unread. 

But that is exactly my intended goal (the former of these options - not the later).

My hope is that in your next encounter with a robin or sparrow, the reading of this guide causes you to pause and observe, even just for a few seconds. To understand enough about these creatures so as to appreciate them. To relate just a bit with them. And perhaps, even to open your heart for just a fraction of a second, to allow the awe and beauty that such a thing exists in this world, to enter in.

That is at least my hope for both you, the reader, and I, the writer. The injection of awe and wonder might be a bit ambitious, so let us scale that back a bit and just strive for you not taking the later path and trashing this worthless thing.
