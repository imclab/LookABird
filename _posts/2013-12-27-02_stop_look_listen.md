## Stop, Look & Listen

Ponder this line of reasoning for a moment. A natural incentive to pay attention to an item, person, or even an idea is to _care_ about that particular entity. We listen and are attentive to our loved ones (or at least we attempt to be), we follow the guidance of our employers and mentors (at least while they are looking), we speak up for political inclinations when they are countered (unless we are in the company of our grandparents - then it isn't worth the effort). 

The coffee cup saved as a memoir from one's home town or a beach vacation is a treasured artifact. The Starbucks receptacle of equal utility is casually discarded in the trash. 

What I am attempting to suggest, in a round-about ineffective way, is that one way to promote the engagement of the _here and now_ is to find things in your immediate and real environment to care about. 

And, what component of nature has enough uniqueness and charm to serve as a latching post for our empathy, while maintaining a near omnipresent status? As you yourself have suggested (the fictionalized form of 'you' I myself created for my own purposes), the answer very well might be _Birds!_

You might not agree with any element of this argument at all. Which is fine. I have the rest of this document to convince you otherwise. 

And with this book, I promote the idea of using birds as a grounding point for focusing our attention away from distraction, from faraway thinking or fictional worlds, and back on the real world that is happening around you. The real world around your feet, in the trees, and flying in the sky.

As a simple rule of thumb to help us engage in this focused observation, may I suggest a simple mantra to adhere to: _Stop, Look & Listen_.

These are the simple requirements to bird observation. We must __stop__ other activities. We must __look__ at the subject at hand. We must __listen__ to their calls.

Think of it as a less catchy form of _Stop, Drop, and Roll_. I am OK with my bird mantra not being as captivating as this one. The ability to detect and terminate self conflagration is a more important topic and deserves the increased attention it receives from its motto.

Or perhaps a better argument would be to think of it as a form of mindful meditation. One with a specific external stimuli as the primary focal point to concentrate on. 

This book will attempt to put us on the path of _Stop, Look & Listen_ by increasing our knowledge of the birds around us and providing motivation to _care_, in some real sense, about these creatures.
