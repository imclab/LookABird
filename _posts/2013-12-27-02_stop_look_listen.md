## Stop, Look & Listen

Ponder this line of reasoning for a moment. A natural incentive to pay attention to an item, person, or even an idea is to _care_ about that particular entity. We listen and are attentive to our loved ones (or at least we attempt to be), we follow the guidance of our employers and mentors (at least while they are looking), we speak up for political inclinations when they are countered (unless we are in the company of our grandparents - then it isn't worth the effort). 

The coffee cup saved as a memoir from one's home town or a beach vacation is a treasured artifact. The Starbucks receptacle of equal utility is casually discarded in the trash. 

What I am attempting to suggest, in a round-about ineffective way, is that one way to promote the engagement of the _here and now_
