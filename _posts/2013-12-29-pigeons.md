## Pigeons

![Pigeon](img/pigeon.png)

To one uninitiated in the practice of bird observation, pigeons would seem a dull, perhaps disgraceful starting point for a bird guide. These _Rats with Wings_ infect our cities and desecrate our automobiles. Or at least this is a prevailing perception for some percentage of city dwellers.

However, if we pause for a moment and think, pigeons provide the perfect opportunity to practice our _Stop, Look & Listen_ process. 

I propose that pigeons are in fact fascinating animals, and we are lucky to be surrounded by them. Depending on my audience, the acceptance of the previous statement might take some convincing. So, let's start by casting these cretins in a different light. I'd like to introduce you to a wonderful and resourceful bird called the _Rock Dove_.

### A Dove By Any Other Name

The animals we know as pigeons are actually a domesticated variant of the bird officially known as the Rock Dove. This bird is known for building its nests and roosting in the cliffs and rock ledges, which is probably why it finds itself so at home in our man-made equivalents - window sills and ledges.

This dove is the first bird domesticated by humans (though you may find some debate from the chicken-lovers out there). Between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago humans decided that they wanted to start seeing more of these rock doves in their lives and began domesticating stocks. The rational was probably more about food then for company. But over time, these animals have shown themselves to be worth their salt (or the salt they were cooked with). 

### Messianic Messengers 

Nearly 3,000 years before the birth of Jesus Christ, ancient Egyptians were using pigeons to communicate messages from ships coming into port.
