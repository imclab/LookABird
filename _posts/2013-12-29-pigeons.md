### Introduction

To one uninitiated in the practice of bird observation, pigeons would seem a dull, perhaps disgraceful starting point for a bird guide. These _Rats with Wings_ infect our cities and desecrate our automobiles. Or at least this is a prevailing perception for some percentage of city dwellers.

However, if we pause for a moment and think, pigeons provide the perfect opportunity to practice our _Stop, Look, Listen_ process. 

I propose that pigeons are in fact fascinating animals, and we are lucky to be surrounded by them. Depending on my audience, the acceptance of the previous statement might take some convincing. So, let's start by casting these cretins in a different light. I'd like to introduce you to a wonderful and resourceful bird called the _Rock Dove_.

### A Dove By Any Other Name

The animals we know as pigeons are actually a domesticated variant of the bird officially known as the Rock Dove. This bird is known for building its nests and roosting in cliffs and rock ledges, which is probably why it finds itself so at home in our man-made equivalents - window sills and ledges.

This dove was the first bird domesticated by humans (though you may find some debate from chicken-lovers). Between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago humans decided that they wanted to start seeing more of these rock doves in their lives and began domesticating stocks. The rational was probably more about food then company. But over time, these animals have shown themselves to be worth their salt (or the salt they were cooked with). 

### Magnetic Messengers 

Nearly 3,000 years before the birth of Christ, ancient Egyptians were using pigeons to communicate messages from ships coming into port.

This messaging system has been utilized ever since by world powers and information distributors. Until 1844 when the telegraph was invented, Homing pigeons were the fastest way to transmit information over long distances. 

The mystery and wonder of this homing ability - to be able to return home from far away and strange lands - is still something scientists are actively studying. This super-bird capability depends on an individuals ability to map out their geographical location and then orient themselves like a compass to get back home. 

The birds are apparently able to utilize a wide variety of external cues to orient themselves and make it back to their nest. The earths magnetic field is one primary indicator for these birds as they have magnetite containing structures in their beaks that allow the reception and processing of this information. The sun's orientation, olfactory cues, and perhaps even visual landmarks are also used as by these remarkable birds.

### A Pigeon Of Another Color

Fortunately for you and me, the whole of society has not overlooked the beauty and the majesty present in these animals. _Pigeon Fanciers_ are those humans who dedicate some portion of their lives to the raising and caring, or at least the admiring, of these birds. One of the more famous (though fictional) pigeon fanciers is Bert from Sesame Street's charming but polarized duo.

Because of the human's propensity to catalog and categorize, these fanciers have bred and labelled a number of different colorful variants of the species. These _color morphs_ add substance and distinction to the observations and experiences of the casual bird observers.

The next time you see a flock of pigeons quietly cooing around a park bench, take the time to stop and look for a few of these classic color combinations.

### Is Poop A Problem?

Part of the bad reputation these birds endure is no doubt just city dwellers taking their frustrations out on these poor little messengers. However, a frequently cited justification for the pigeon-hate is that pigeons spread disease.

Now it is certainly true that pigeon poop is not something most would ask to be applied to their houses, cars, or personal belongings - but that can be said about most fecal matter, regardless of the originating animal. Is it true that these creatures are major harbingers of disease and death?

Though they have been living and communing with us for as long as history has been recorded, even this simple question is still much debated. While pigeon poop does contain some organisms known to be harmful to us - particularly fungi - some research indicates that the actual pigeon-to-human transfer of these maladies is actually quite rare under normal circumstances. 

Perhaps a telling observation that may help convince us, the casual bird observer, that these accusations are hogwash is the length of time man has spent with these birds in or near their homes. 10,000 years is a long time to go without getting sick.
